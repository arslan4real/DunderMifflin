                        Okay. Happy St. Patrick's Day. [Starts to leave office] And also, I would like to say that I will be canceling my trip down to Tallahassee. 
                        Although I do look forward to our professional relationship.  Right there. My sanctuary. My party pad. Someday I can just see my grandkids 
                        learning how to walk out here. Hang a swing from this tree. Push them back... wait... [turns around] no, it's this one, right here. Home, 
                        sweet home.   That was a hit job.  If you read the Dunder Mifflin press release it clearly states that they had absolutely nothing to do 
                        with that particular cancer cluster.  So if there is a lesson to be learned here and I'm not sure that there is, it is that in order to help
                         our communities, we need to put other people's needs ahead of our own.

                        Is it a priority? Oh I don't know, um, what if there is a tornado, Pam? People's legs are crushed under rubble. "Please, would you be so kind 
                        as to call my wife? No, I can't because we don't have any emergency contact information because Pam said it wasn't a priority." Think. Think 
                        with your head, Pam. Ok, well. She walks out. That's the problem with being a boss is that when you are tough they resent you and when you are 
                        cool they walk all over you. Oh, OK. Masters of comedy. A guy dropped his pants. Have you ever been to the circus? [everyone glares] OK. 
                        [Michael puts his finger through his pant's zipper] He's back! [laughs] OK. Hmm. [babbling with his coat pulled closed] Waagh! [flashes everyone] 
                        Rachel thinks that I brought homemade potato salad and I just picked it up at the supermarket. It's funny. I wish I could make potato salad that good.
                         It's just potatoes and mayonnaise. There is something wrong with Jan.

                        I think in order to be a ladies man, it's imperative that people don't know you're a ladies man, so I kind of play that close to the chest. 
                        I don't know, what can I say? Women are attracted to power. And I think other people have told me that I have a very symmetrical face. [laughs] 
                        I don't know. I don't know. Maybe they're right?  I don't know.  When I was sixteen, I was supposed to go out on a date with a girl named Julie. 
                        But there was another Michael in the class that she apparently thought the date was with, so she went out with him, on my birthday. And, she got 
                        him a cake, at the restaurant. And it wasn't even his birthday, but I heard about it the next day in school. So... That was the worst birthday I 
                        think I ever had.   There she sat.  Her name was Pam.  She was a receptionist.  She was engaged to an animal.  There sat Jim.  He was a gawky, 
                        tall salesman.  The odds of them getting together were insur-mountain-able.  I made a family!  I got these two together, and I made a family.
